diffy is a dead stupid diff tool.

- curl -F red=@1 green=@2 https://diffy works for 99% of people
- also git diff | curl https://diffy
- Storage: object storage, local cache in Bolt + Cloudflare cache.
- Retention policy: 5 hits in the first month, then minimum 10 hits per year. Can obviously just be crawlers.
